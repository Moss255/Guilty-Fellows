# Guilty-Fellows

This was a small game project I used in my portfolio back in 2017 to apply for some universities.

I was inspired to use Haxe after seeing it was used on Papers, Please.

The language is pretty cool ngl, many of the art assets are missing from this game but the proof of concept is there.
