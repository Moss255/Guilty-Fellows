# Guilty-Fellows

This was a small game project I used in my portfolio back in 2017 to apply for some universities.

I was inspired to use Haxe after seeing it was used on Papers, Please.

The language is pretty cool ngl, many of the art assets are missing from this game but the proof of concept is there.

Fact fun: If you would like to customise the game yourself, just modify the characters.json. That will modify the character's names, text and whether they are the suspect or not. Spoiler!!
